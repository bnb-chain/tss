Cli and transportation wrapper of [tss-lib](https://github.com/binance-chain/tss-lib)

## Setup in real world
1. start a bootstrap server `../tss -listen_addr="/ip4/172.31.31.230/tcp/27148" -dht_sever_mode=true` and log the node id of it
2. run setup with bootstrap server id `./tss --p2p.bootstraps="/ip4/172.31.31.230/tcp/27148/p2p/<bootstrap_server_node_id>" --mode="setup"`
3. distribute configs generated by `setup` in step2 to different devices
4. start client with their config files `./tss --home="<path_to_dir_of_config_file>"`

## Setup 2-3 scheme communicate with real p2p on local machine
`./setup_lan.sh`

## Test keygen for 10 parties in memory
```sh
cd client
go test -run TestWhole
```

## Supported NAT Types

Referred to https://github.com/libp2p/go-libp2p/issues/375#issuecomment-407122416 We also have three nat-traversal solutions at the moment.

1. UPnP/NATPortMap 
<br><br> When NAT traversal is enabled (in go-libp2p, pass the NATPortMap() option to the libp2p constructor), libp2p will use UPnP and NATPortMap to ask the NAT's router to open and forward a port for libp2p. If your router supports either UPnP or NATPortMap, this is by far the best option.

2. STUN/hole-punching
<br><br> LibP2P has it's own version of the "STUN" protocol using peer-routing, external address discovery, and reuseport.

3. TURN-like protocol (relay)
<br><br> Finally, we have a TURN like protocol called p2p-circuit. This protocol allows libp2p nodes to "proxy" through other p2p nodes. All party clients registered to mainnet would automatically announce they support p2p-circuit (relay) for tss implementation.



### In WAN setting

| | Full cone | (Address)-restricted-cone | Port-restricted cone	| Symmetric NAT |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
|Bootstrap (tracking) server| ✓ | ✘ | ✘ | ✘ |
|Relay server| ✓ | ✘ | ✘ | ✘ |
|Client| ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (relay server needed) |

### In LAN setting

Nodes can connected to each other directly without setting bootstrap and relay server. But host(ip)&port of expectedPeers should be configured.
